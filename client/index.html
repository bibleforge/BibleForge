Welcome to hacking BibleForge.

This is the first file that is loaded when BibleForge loads.  It is pretty simple.
It just creates some HTML elements and loads the external JavaScript and CSS.
In the future, this will probably be generated by the server to add more advanced features.

Most of the code is found in js/lang/en.js, js/main.js, and js/secondary.js.

js/lang/en.js is the first external script to be loaded.  It creates some special functions and
variables specific to the English language.  Lord willing, in the future, other languages will
be supported and will be loaded based on the clients' IP address or settings.

js/main.js is the heart of BibleForge.  All of the essential code is in there.  That's a good place
to start at.  Understanding that code will help you understand the rest.

js/secondary.js is lazily loaded by js/main.js.  It contains code that is not essential to
BibleForge or that can be loaded later with no impact to BibleForge's usability.  It is loaded
later to make BibleForge start quicker.

styles/base.css is also loaded, which contains the essential styles for BibleForge.  Other styles,
which may be loaded later, are located in styles/night.css.
